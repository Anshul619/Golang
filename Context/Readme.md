# Context in Go
- [Context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) provides a mechanism to control the lifecycle, cancellation, and propagation of requests across multiple goroutines.

# Benefits

| Benefit                                                                                                                                   |

| Propagate deadlines or timeouts across API boundaries and between goroutines.                                                             |
| Signal cancellation (e.g. when a client disconnects, or when a timeout is hit).                                                           |
| Carry request-scoped values (like auth tokens, request IDs) across API calls without polluting function signatures with extra parameters. |

# Best Practices

| Title                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pass Context Explicitly            | Always pass the context as an explicit argument to functions or goroutines instead of using global variables. <br/>- This makes it easier to manage the contextâ€™s lifecycle and prevents potential data races.                 |
| Use `context.TODO()`               | If you are unsure which context to use in a particular scenario, consider using `context.TODO()`. However, make sure to replace it with the appropriate context later.                                                         |
| Avoid using `context.Background()` | Instead of using `context.Background()` directly, create a specific context using `context.WithCancel()` or `context.WithTimeout()` to manage its lifecycle and avoid resource leaks.                                          |
| Prefer Cancel Over Timeout         | Use `context.WithCancel()` for cancellation when possible, as it allows you to explicitly trigger cancellation when needed. <br/>- `context.WithTimeout()` is more suitable when you need an automatic cancellation mechanism. |
| Keep Context Size Small            | Avoid storing large or unnecessary data in the context. Only include the data required for the specific operation.                                                                                                             |
| Avoid Chaining Contexts            | Chaining contexts can lead to confusion and make it challenging to manage the context hierarchy. <br/>- Instead, propagate a single context throughout the application.                                                        |
| Be Mindful of Goroutine Leaks      | Always ensure that goroutines associated with a context are properly closed or terminated to avoid goroutine leaks.                                                                                                            |

# Context in Real-World Scenarios

| Title                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Context in Microservices | In a microservices architecture, each service often relies on various external dependencies and communicates with other services. <br/>- Context can be used to propagate important information, such as **authentication tokens**, **request metadata**, or **tracing identifiers**, throughout the service interactions. |
| Context in Test Suites   | When writing test suites, context can be utilized to manage test timeouts, control test-specific configurations, and enable graceful termination of tests.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Context in Web Servers   | Web servers handle multiple concurrent requests, and context helps manage the lifecycle of each request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
