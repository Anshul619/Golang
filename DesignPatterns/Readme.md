| [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)            | Creational Patterns | Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. |
| [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)        | Creational Patterns | Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                            |
| [Adapter Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)                  | Structural Patterns | Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.                                                                                 |
| [Singleton in Go](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/go/example)     | Creational Patterns | Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.                         |
| [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)                            | Structural Patterns | Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.                                              |
| [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)                          | Creational Patterns | Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)                        | Behavioral Patterns | Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.          |
| [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)                        | Behavioral Patterns | Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.                    |
