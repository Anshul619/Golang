# What are go modules?
- The Go toolchain has a built-in system for managing versioned sets of related packages, known as [modules](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module).
- Similar to a standard Go package, a [module may contain any number of packages and sub-packages](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-go-modules), or it may contain none at all.

````go
go mod init example/project //Create module
go get golang.org/x/text@v0.3.5 //To add, upgrade, or downgrade a dependency
````

# How to build and install Go Programs? (Go-CLI commands)
- Go does have an extensive library, called [the runtime](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime), that is part of every Go program.
- The runtime library implements garbage collection, [concurrency](GoRoutines&Channels.md), stack management, and other critical features of the Go language.
- It is important to understand, however, that Go's runtime does not include a virtual machine, such as is provided by the Java runtime.
- Go programs are compiled ahead of time to native machine code.
