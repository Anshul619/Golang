# What is Golang?
- [Go](https://go.dev/) is a high level, general-purpose programming language that is [very strongly and statically typed](OOPs/TypesGo.md) by providing support for garbage collection and [concurrent programming](ConcurrencyGoRoutines).
- Go technically is [pass by value](Pointers.md).
- Go is a [case-sensitive language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity).
