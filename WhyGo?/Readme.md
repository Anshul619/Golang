# :star: Why is Golang fast compared to other languages?
- Golang is faster than other programming languages because of its simple and efficient memory management and [concurrency model](../ConcurrencyGoRoutines).
- The compilation process to machine code is very fast and efficient.
- Additionally, the dependencies are linked to a single binary file thereby putting off dependencies on servers.
- It also uses a compile-link model for generating executable binaries from the source code.

# :+1: What are the advantages of Golang over other languages?

| Advantage                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :star: Support for concurrency                      | Go provides very good support for concurrency using [Go Routines & channels](../../Concurrency-Go/readme.md).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Simple and Understandable                           | Go was developed by keeping simplicity, maintainability and readability in mind. Hence easy to learn.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Standard Powerful Library                           | Go supports all standard libraries and packages that help in writing code easily and efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Static Type Checking                                | Go is a very strong and [statically typed programming language.](../https://github.com/Anshul619/LLD-OOPs-Design-Patterns-Go/OOPs/TypesGo.md)<br/>- This ensures that the code is type-safe and all type conversions are handled efficiently.                                                                                                  |
| Easy to install binaries                            | Go provides support for generating binaries for the applications with all required dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Good Testing Support                                | Go has good support for [writing unit test cases](../Testing/Readme.md) along with our code.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Fast Compiled Time                                  | Go is designed for quick compilation without the need for dependency checking, so it addresses the build pain.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Compiled Language                                   | Go is a compiled language, and thus runs several orders of magnitude faster than interpreted languages, like Python or Ruby.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Transparent Type System                             | Go is easy to figure out how much everything your programâ€™s trying to do will cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Strings Processing                                  | Google built a rich library of string functions into Go, Garbage collecting makes strings in Go simple to think about, and efficient in ways some other string libraries are not.                                                                                                     |
| Efficient [Garbage Collection](../GarbageCollector) |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Memory Efficient                                    | Go is designed to be memory efficient with lessor memory footprint (due to efficient [Garbage Collection](../GarbageCollector), no class/object overhead, no virtual machine, efficient [concurrency model](../../Concurrency-Go/readme.md)), which saves hardware costs as well. |
